# Java-Spring-Boot
Here is a mini project that I have created. With this Java Project, I used Spring Boot to initialise the data and send it through a H2 in memory database, Postman.
I used Postman for this project as it is clear and concise and assists with understanding the movement and transferral of data.

To improve this project, I would like to add a front end functionality.
