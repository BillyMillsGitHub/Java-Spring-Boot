# Java-Spring-Boot
Here is a mini porject that I have created. With this Java Project, I used Spring Boot to initialise the data and send it through an in memeory database, Postman.
I used Postman for this project as it is clear and concise and assists with understanding the movement and transferral of data.

To improve this project, I will be initializing the live server through a Docker Database. Currently, I am having technical issues with Docker. 

I understand that with just a few commands in Docker and uncommenting some code in the Java file then this could be up and running on a Docker Database. Alongside this, I would need to chnage the classpath to ensure that the data is not sent through to the Postman in memory database and in fact is transferred correctly.
